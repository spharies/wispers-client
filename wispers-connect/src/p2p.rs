//! Peer-to-peer connection types.
//!
//! This module provides the types for establishing and managing P2P connections
//! between activated nodes. Two transport types are supported:
//!
//! - **UDP** ([`UdpConnection`]): Raw UDP with AES-GCM encryption. Low overhead, unreliable delivery.
//! - **QUIC** ([`QuicConnection`]): QUIC streams with TLS-PSK. Reliable, ordered delivery with flow control.
